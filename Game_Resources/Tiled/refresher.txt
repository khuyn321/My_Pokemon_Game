Tiled is a free, popular map editor for tile-based games. It allows you to paint with tiles like Photoshop, but on a grid.

You can:
    - Create ground, details, foreground, collision
    - Make object Layers for spawn points, doors, more precise collisions, etc.

The game I'm making uses Tiled through:
    - Loading the tileset images
    - Loading the JSON / TMX(XML) data
    - For each layer, then cell: Computing the source rectangle in the tileset, then drawing it (context.drawImage(...))
    - Builds a collision grid from the collision layer and check it when moving the player

  Tileset vs. Tilemap:

  ___Tileset___
    - A collection of graphical tiles (smaller image pieces used to build the maps)
      ðŸ’¡ Think: One big graph paper sticker sheet with each square being 32 x 32 px each

  ___Tilemap___
    - a 2D sizeable array of numbers (IDs) that say which tile goes in each cell
    - Looks something like this:
    [ 0,0,0,1,1
      0,2,2,1,1
      0,0,3,3,3 ]
